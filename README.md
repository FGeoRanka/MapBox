# ShakeCro-Team
//Hi to anyone that is reading this file!

So the main point of this project was to create an interactive map of area of Zagreb, Croatia. The map's goal is to create isochrones arounf any point 
that you click on a map. Isochrones created are referencing to walking duration of 10, 15 and 20 minutes. The main goal of isochrones is to show the closest 
''safe from earthquake'' area. There are 68 ''safe from earthquake areas'' and each of them has a pop up window with their name when you click on them.
The entire project was done using Mapbox Isochrone API where you can generate your free access token and use it in your code. Also, all of that was running on 
a public server so the entire project was done using free open source databases and API tokens.
There are a lot more files, that were initially creating this repository but are not here as they are hidden (containing confidential data about us).
If you were to use this code, I suggest installing every extension Mapbox has to offer.

Greetings from Franka, Ivan, Josip and our mentor Dino!
